This model simulates the contribution of dendritic Na+ and D-type K+
channels to EPSPs at three different locations of apical dendrites,
which mimicking innervation sites of mossy fibers (MF), recurrent
fibers (AC), and perforant pathway (PP).

The model files are associated with the figure 7 of the paper:

mediates heterosynaptic modulation of direct cortical synaptic inputs
in CA3 pyramidal cells. J. Physiol. 593(16): 3617-3643.

In this paper, we investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying
MF-induced heterosynaptic long-term potentiation of perforant path
(PP) inputs to CA3 pyramidal cells. We showed that this heterosynaptic
potentiation is mediated by downregulation of Kv1.2 channels, which
comprises D-type K current. The downregulation of Kv1.2 preferentially
enhanced PP-evoked EPSPs which occur at distal apical dendrites. Such
enhancement of PP-EPSPs required activation of dendritic Na+ channels,
and its threshold was lowered by downregulation of Kv1.2.

Note that the color codes for traces of Fig7C-E (for example the MF in
7Da):

are as follows:
1) blue, EPSPs at the soma
2) red, EPSPs at an apical dendrite of stratum radiatum (AC synaptic
site)
3) green, EPSPs at an apical dendrite of stratum lacunosum moleculare
(PP synaptic site)

In Fig7C*.hoc and Fig7D*.hoc, EPSPs will be simlulated under the
conditions of following order:
1) control
2) low Gkd (10% of control)
3) low Gkd & low dendritic Na channel (50%)
4) Normal Gkd & low dendritic Na channel
